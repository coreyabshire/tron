Welcome to my entry into the Google AI Challenge 2010. My entry
is a pretty straightforward implementation of many of the algorithms
that eventually made their way to being published on the forum. 
Thus, it doesn't end up doing all that great in the actual competition.
However, it is a pretty easy to understand implementation, and I
learned a lot from participating. I decided to release it online
in case anyone else once to study it, learn from it, and make any
suggestions for improving it.
